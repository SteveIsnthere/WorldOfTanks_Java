# Average Battle Simulator

## *finally, a strategy game for the rest of us*


What does it do:
- Battle budget can be set to however (high) you want
- Fully customizable battle units deployment
- Customizable battle units like tanks
- **(future-feature yet to be implemented)** Auto combat
- **(future-feature yet to be implemented)** graphics with style
- **(future-feature yet to be implemented)** super easy to use world builder, design your very own battle scenario!

Who will play it:
- Anyone who is bored enough to waste their time on this


Why this is project of interest to me:
- I'm a huge fan of any kind of simulator.
- Each type of battle unit can be a class of its own
- Since Java is a compiled language, some large scale simulation would be possible
   
## *user stories*
- As a user, I want the Settings/Game setup to be saved after each time I changed them
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my Settings/Game setup from file
- As a user, I want to be able to change the Battle budget.
- As a user, I want to be able to add BattleUnits to my army.
- As a user, I want to be able to control how many tanks/troops to be included in my army.
- As a user, I want to be able to customize the tanks to be added to my army.
- As a user, I want to be able to engage battle with the enemy army.


##Phase 4: Task 2
Eventlog samples:
- Fri Apr 01 15:55:29 PDT 2022
A battle unit got shot! Remaining hp: 23375.0

- Fri Apr 01 15:55:32 PDT 2022
A battle unit fired a shot! unit cost: 6.3375

##Phase 4: Task 3
Based on the UML diagram I drew, I think it's better to create more super classes that can save me huge time for me
otherwise wasted writing 
repetive code.
